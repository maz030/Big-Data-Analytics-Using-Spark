    "# Southeast Arizona Weather Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that approximately overlaps the area of the southeast Arizona, close to city Tucson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from This [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><img alt=\"map.png\" src=\"hw5_figures/map.png\" style=\"height:300px; width:500px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sanity-check: comparison with outside sources\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We start by comparing some of the general statistics with graphs that we obtained from a site called <a href=\"http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/boston/massachusetts/united-states/usma0046\" target=\"_blank\">US Climate Data</a> The graph below shows the daily minimum and maximum temperatures for each month, as well as the total precipitation for each month. The data is from city Tucson, Arizona, which is very close to the area of our dataset in HW5.</p>\n",

    "<p><img alt=\"tucson_onweb.jpg\" src=\"hw5_figures/tucson_onweb.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /></p>\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We see that the min and max daily temperature agree with the ones we got from our data. In our data, the value of y axis divided by 10 is equal to the actual temperature in centigrade. For example, the highest temperature is in early July. In the plot TMAX, we see the mean TMAX in July is 37 celsiusï¼Œ which converted to Fahrenheit is 98.6. It is very close to the peek in the graph from US Climate Data. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<P><img alt=\"TMIN_TMAX\" src=\"hw5_figures/TMIN_TMAX.png\"></P>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we compare PRCP. We can see the shape of the curve of our data is very close to the data from the website. For example, the highest precipitation is in August. From our data, we see the daily PRCP in August is about 21/10 = 2.1 mm. So in month, PRCP is 2.1*30 = 63mm per month. When converted to inch, it is 2.48 inch per month. And the peek in the histogram above is very close to 2.48 inch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, we can clearly see the precipitation between April and June is very low. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;<img alt=\"PRCP.png\" src=\"hw5_figures/PRCP.png\" style=\"height:450px; width:600px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We also have the data for SNOW and SNWD. In the graph we see in summer, there is little snow in that area. And in other months of the year, the snow is also very rare because the mean is close to 0.</p>\n",
    "<p><img alt=\"SNOW\" src=\"hw5_figures/SNOW.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data and graph we generated, combining with our knowledge, all these conclusions are reasonable. Arizona is rounded by desert and is very hot in summer. Also, due to local climate, precipitation is very low and almost no snow over the year."

    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 8.5% of the variance for PRCP and 16% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain %87 of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. \n",
    "It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years.\n",
